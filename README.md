# video-container
//an attempt to create video container to create/log/parse/send meta data on video play usage by file
this deign is hoped to act as a informatic data send/recieve process on the plays a video has regardless of its organisational 
storage and ownership. the aim is to provide a unique video contaier that utilizes exisiting codec (non specific) to play the file 
where it is hosted.
the reason for this is that many, many video are simply not played and in cold storage on a server somehwhere taking up valuable 
resource space.

with a container the task would be not only to anlysie the video file usage but to build in operable planned obselescence - thus 
when a file has not been used in any specified time frame it automatically deletes....

the benefits to system admins are obvious - but also to the video creator or owner as meta data can be pulled at any time from the
container - allowing for example marketing analytics, system administration and so on.

Whilst this is a white stage design - the initial thoughht are that a JS. conatiner could be used - though as the author is of \
this text is non technical its just a guess at present.
